# convex-research-assistant

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Start, Convex, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Start** - SSR framework with TanStack Router
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Convex** - Reactive backend-as-a-service platform
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **Vite+** - Unified Vite toolchain, workspace task runner, linting, and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Convex Setup

This project uses Convex as a backend. You'll need to set up Convex before running the app:

```bash
pnpm run dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project and connect it to your application.

Copy environment variables from `packages/backend/.env.local` to `apps/*/.env`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Your app will connect to the Convex cloud backend automatically.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@convex-research-assistant/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `pnpm run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

For Cloudflare, Alchemy loads and validates deployment inputs with `varlock/auto-load` in its Node/Bun deployment process. Worker code reads native bindings; web clients use the framework's public env API through `src/env.public.ts` where needed. Alchemy supplies resource URLs and managed database credentials. In-Worker Varlock protections are deferred until an official Alchemy integration is available; see [the non-Wrangler deployment guidance](https://varlock.dev/integrations/cloudflare/#non-wrangler-deploy-tools-alchemy-sst-pulumi).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: web on Cloudflare
- Configure provider accounts: `cd packages/infra && pnpm exec alchemy profile edit`
- Dev: pnpm run dev
- Deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: pnpm run destroy

`alchemy profile edit` stores the selected Axiom, Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && pnpm exec alchemy deploy --stage production
```

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Optional native Vite+ hooks: `pnpm run hooks:setup`
- Docs: [Vite+ commit hooks](https://viteplus.dev/guide/commit-hooks)
- Run checks: `pnpm run check`
